Swipe.js WordPress Plugin
=============

A WordPress plugin for the [swipe.js][Swipe] slider.

Installation
------------

### Creating Slides
Install the plugin as usual. You will see a new custom post option type called SwipeJS. Create a new post in this section. Give it a title and a featured image. All the posts are in ascending order. This means that the newest post will appear as the last image.

### Options
You will see a new SwipeJS option in your settings menu. In here you will find all the settings for the slider. All the options are the same as the original swipe.js slider.

### Pagination and Controls
You can add pagination and prev/next controls to the slider. Included are some default styles.
